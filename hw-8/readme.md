## Week eight wow it's going by so fast

#### Work cycle process

For this week, I reviewed the course material and then basically just brainstormed for a really long time and randomly played with things until I got to a point that I liked. I started out trying to make a flower, had to use the reference page, and then finally got something that I liked at least a little bit. I used some randomizers so that the flowers looked really really cool and I thought it sort of looked like something in space.

I liked that thought, so I changed the colors and added some "stars"  in the background. I think it kinda looks like an eclipse with radiating colors.
