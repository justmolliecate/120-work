## Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I want to explore the concept of Perlin noise. I love the calming, smooth aspect of perlin-generated artwork and I have felt very inspired by just searching generative and perlin based art. I don't quite yet know what form this will take, but it will be some sort of complex generative artwork that has a smooth and calming affect.

#### Challenges and other things

I have never worked with Perlin noise before, so I will be exporing a new concept and using that to create cool art. I expect I will be googling and researching a lot in order to implement what I want into my code. I envision that this style of coding will be very useful for me in the future with data visualization and things like that.

#### Timeline

Due to unforseen circumstances, I'm getting started on this a lot later than I would like. I'm planning on jumping right into coding and experimenting with things and researching as I go in order to create a finished product by the time that the deadline rolls around. Luckily, with fewer in-person classes, I have more time than the average student to dedicate to this project in the next two weeks.
