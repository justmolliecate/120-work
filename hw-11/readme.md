## Read Me week 11

For this week, I couldn't decide on a cohesive idea that I liked. I played around with a lot of different things but nothing stuck, so I went back to the basics and began to just write the simple code template for something and then kind of went from there. I like what the end result is. It's kind of like an explosion that disperses over time.

I didn't pay too much attention to the issues board becuase I was just working at my own pace. I really enjoy getting to see what everyone else does for their projects. I think it helps expand the realm of what is possible with coding.
