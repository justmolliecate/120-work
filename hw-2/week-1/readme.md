# Week one work cycle

For this homework cycle I simply followed along and completed all of the todo's. Some of this I had already done because I took web design last semester. I am not super familiar with terminal but I really want to learn to use it so I forced myself to use it for all my navigating.

I did not have any problems or issues, and therefore did not post to the class repo issue tracker.

I think everything we learned was pretty basic and I hope most people understood what was going on!
